\title{Fitted values for BLC fitted models}
\usage{
\method{fitted}{BLC}(object, cred = 0.95, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{BLC} object, result of a call to blc() function.}

\item{cred}{A real number that indicates the probability of the credible interval.}

\item{...}{Other arguments.}
}
\value{
A list with the matrices of fitted values and lower and upper limits of the credible interval for each age and year.
}
\description{
Computes the fitted values associated to each age and year based on
the resulting chains from a fitted BLC model. In addition, this function also
evaluates the values of lower and upper limits of the credible interval.
}
\examples{
## Importing log-mortality data from Portugal:
data(PT)
Y <- PT

## Fitting the model
fit = blc(Y = Y, numit = 100, warmup = 20)

## Log-mortalities estimates for each age and year in model fitted
fitted(fit, cred = 0.95)
